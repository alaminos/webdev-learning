            <h1>A quick review of the resources I use</h1>
            <section id="introduction">
                <header>Introduction:</header>
<p>I am currently focusing on learning <em>well</em> the three basic web technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
    For the time being, I do not want to rely too much on popular tools like jQuery or Bootstrap, 
    because libraries and frameworks come and go, today React is the hot thing, tomorrow who knows. 
    That is why I prefer to develop a mastery of the core languages.</p> 
                <p>The best way to learn is to practice, practice, practice. 
                    There is no way around this. 
                    There are a lot of resources out there: videos, books, blogs, interactive environments, etc. 
                    and there are mentors for those who can afford it. 
                    But the key thing, in my opinion, is to have a questioning and tinkering attitude. 
                    That is, to go onto the console or the chosen IDE and start making things, 
                    experimenting with what you have learned, placing it into perspective, 
                    taking yourself out of the comfort zone and finding new challenges. 
                    And you will end up, without a doubt, using Google, StackOverFlow or a friendly chatroom to find some help.</p>
                <p>UPDATE 08/12/2017: Spaced-repetition is a powerful tool that I should learn to use. 
                    I don't mean I should have an Anki desktop with questions an answers about JavaScript. 
                    But periodically coming back to the same problems helps enormously at consolidating new knowledge. And these periods should be longer and longer.
 
                    How to do that? I am still trying to figure out the best learning system for me, but some habits or rules that could help are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write down the difficult problems you have encountered and their solutions and make sure you review your notes monthly or so</li>
                    <li>Keep a blog and post about your projects. But better work in something different between the completion of your project and the blog post about it so that they are spaced out in time. </li>
                    <li>If you have found a new concept particularly challenging during your last project, you could do an ad hoc mini-project about that concept. For example let's say your last project was a guessing game, and you worked with an array and you found out that you don't know much about arrays and that there exist all this array methods and so on and so forth. So your next project won't be a working webapp (because there are so many things into it besides arrays), but it should be something super-focused on arrays, maybe just a program without html/css skin.</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="freecodecamp">
                <header>FREECODECAMP:</header>
<p>This platform gave me the definite kick-start boost to get serious in this path. It has a extremely supportive community, which is very important for those of us who learn on our own. Although the curriculum is, as of today (23/062017), a bit outdated, there is a newer one in beta that anyone can see <a href="http://beta.freecodecamp.com/en/">here</a>. The exercises are not great and some have awkward explanations, however you can skip them and go directly to the projects or jump around. Three things make FreeCodeCamp important: the projects, the community and the possibility to work on real life projects once you have accomplished your web development FreeCodeCamp certification.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="practical-js">                <header>PRACTICAL JAVASCRIPT: </header>
<p>This is, in my opinion, <a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript">the BEST course</a> for beginners. In the format of video-tutorial, it starts with JavaScript without presupposing any knowledge. So you begin playing with the Chrome console from the very beginning and you are introduced to the magic of the debugger very early on. While most JS courses focuses on the syntax (this is how you declare a variable, and this is how you do a for loop, etc), this course is project based, you learn the things when they are needed to accomplish the task at hand and the explanations are superb. The tutor focuses on the importance of UNDERSTANDING, as opposed to memorising a bunch of tags, keywords, syntax, etc.</p>
<p>While other courses throw piles of theory at you, (information that you can perhaps understand but not fully comprehend because you can't relate it to any real work), in this course you get practice first, you confront problems, you learn new strategies, and when the time is just ripe you get the theory and everything goes click. You can tell that behind the course design there has been a lot of work at deconstructing the (surprisingly complex) project of building a (seemingly simple) to-do app.<p>

                <header>LEARNING HOW TO LEARN:</header>
<p>As a foreign language teacher and as a learner of many different things, I have always been interested in that thing we call "learning". 
    So it was a matter of time that I would end up finding and doing <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">this course</a> . 
It is concise but offers a lot of good insights into good learning strategies, sometimes backed by latest neuroscience research. 
I did this course before I decided to become a web developer, but I think it has improved the way I study.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="project-euler">
                <header>PROGRAMMING EXERCISES: </header>
<p>Project Euler for example is an archive of mathematical challenges of increasing difficulty. 
    When you just want to practice your algorithmic skills, this kind of sites give you just what you need: 
    problems to solve. Fortunately, this site is not the only one of its kind.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="eloquent">
                <header>ELOQUENT JAVASCRIPT:</header>
<p>I wouldn't rely on <em>just</em> this book, because it often presupposes some knowledge that you may not have. I read a new chapter every month or so, and take my time with the exercises. The exercises are not always easy, but in my opinion, they are the most important part. This problem-solving process is weight-lifting for your brain. A path without obstacles is a path without learning.</p>
