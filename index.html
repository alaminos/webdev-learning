The best way to learn is to practice, practice, practice. There is no way around this. There are a lot of resources out there: videos, books, blogs, interactive environments, etc. Some lucky ones have mentors. But the key thing, in my opinion, is to have a questioning and tinkering attitude. That is, to go onto the console or the chosen IDE and start making things, experimenting with what you have learned, placing it into perspective, taking yourself out of the comfort zone and finding new challenges. And you will end up, without a doubt, using Google, StackOverFlow or a friendly chatroom to find some help.

                <header>FREECODECAMP:</header>
The curriculum is outdated but there is a newer one in beta that anyone can see <a href="beta.freecodecamp.com">here</a>.  The exercises are not great  (there is not much problem solving involved, and there is no context) and some are awkward. However you can skip them and go directly to the projects or jump around. Three things make FreeCodeCamp important: the projects, the community and the possibility to work on real life projects once you have accomplished your web development FreeCodeCamp certification.

            <section class="main-section" id="practical-js">
                <header>PRACTICAL JAVASCRIPT: </header>
This is, in my opinion, the BEST course. Instead of starting with HTML and CSS like most courses do, it starts with JavaScript, and it just makes sense. So you begin playing with the Chrome console from the very beginning and you are introduced to the magic of the debugger very early on. While most JS courses focuses on the syntax (this is how you declare a variable, and this is how you do a for loop, etc), this course is project based, you learn the things when they are needed to accomplish the task at hand and the explanations are superb. The tutor focuses on the importance of UNDERSTANDING, as opposed to memorising a bunch of tags, keywords, syntax, etc. 
While other courses throw piles of theory at you, (information that you can perhaps understand but not fully comprehend because you can't relate it to any real work), in this course you get practice first, you confront problems, you learn new strategies, and when the time is just ripe you get the theory and everything goes click.

                <header>DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP UDEMY:</header>
This one was recommended to me but so far I haven't been impressed. It starts with the basics of HTML and CSS but you can skip to the juicy parts whenever you want. I haven't used this course much so I can't really write a proper review just yet. One thing for sure it looks very complete. 
If I said at the top of this page that having an active attitude is important (as opposed to just watching videotutorials or just reading) it is also true that sometimes I just want to watch something and relax, or perhaps watch it while chopping my vegetables in the kitchen, at these times this course come handy.

                <header>LEARNING HOW TO LEARN:</header>
As a foreign language teacher and as a learner of many different things, I have always been interested by that thing we call "learning". So it was a matter of time that I would end up finding and doing this course. The course is concise but offers a lot of good insights into good learning strategies, sometimes backed by latest neuroscience research. Web developers are constantly learning so I think it might be a good idea doing this course and being more aware of our own learning processes. You may already "know" how to learn, you have probably developed a series of strategies without being really aware of it..

                <header>PROJECT EULER: </header>
An archive of mathematical challenges of increasing difficulty. When you just want to practice your algorithmic skills, these sites give you just what you need: problems to solve. I think this site is gold and that's why I have searched for more of this kind.  I list them here but I can't recommend any one in particular as I haven't tested them.

                <header>DECOUVREZ LE LANGAGE JAVASCRIPT: </header>
I am also learning French and my goal is to land a developer job in France. When you have several hobbies, or there are several fields that are of interest to you, it is a good strategy to combine them in a single activity. This is why this book, while not being specific for learning french, and while is definitely not the best resource for learning JS, it is a good read for my free time away from the screen.

            <section class="main-section" id="you-dont-know-js" >
                <header>YOU DON'T KNOW JS: </header>
This book has been recommended by a lot of people, and is now in my pending shelf. It is actually a 6 book series and you can read them for free. Its focus is on understanding JavaScript and on what happens underneath.

            <section class="main-section" id="eloquent">
                <header>ELOQUENT JAVASCRIPT:</header>
If YOU DON'T KNOW JS is to books, what <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004782/">John Keating</a> is to teachers, Eloquent Javascript would be the type of cold and distant Zen master that answers your questions with a riddle.
This is NOT really for beginners. The explanations are not aiming to clarity and sometimes it presupposes knowledge that you may not have already.  I wouldn't rely on <em>just</em> this book. I read a new chapter every month or so, and take my time with the exercises. The exercises are not always easy, but in my opinion, they are the most important part. This problem-solving process is weight-lifting for your brain. A path without obstacles is a path without learning.
