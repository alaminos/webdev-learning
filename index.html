                <header>Introduction:</header>
<p>I am currently focusing on learning <em>well</em> the three basic web technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the time being, I do not want to rely too much on popular tools like jQuery or Bootstrap. Libraries and frameworks come and go, today React is the hot thing, tomorrow who knows. That is why I prefer to develop a mastery of the core languages.</p> <p>The best way to learn is to practice, practice, practice. There is no way around this. There are a lot of resources out there: videos, books, blogs, interactive environments, etc. There are mentors for those who can afford it. But the key thing, in my opinion, is to have a questioning and tinkering attitude. That is, to go onto the console or the chosen IDE and start making things, experimenting with what you have learned, placing it into perspective, taking yourself out of the comfort zone and finding new challenges. And you will end up, without a doubt, using Google, StackOverFlow or a friendly chatroom to find some help.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="freecodecamp">
                <header>FREECODECAMP:</header>
<p>This platform gave me the definite kick-start boost to get serious in this path. It has a extremely supportive community, which is very important for those of us who learn on our own. Although the curriculum is, as of today (23/062017), a bit outdated, there is a newer one in beta that anyone can see <a href="http://beta.freecodecamp.com/en/">here</a>. The exercises are not great and some have awkward explanations, however you can skip them and go directly to the projects or jump around. Three things make FreeCodeCamp important: the projects, the community and the possibility to work on real life projects once you have accomplished your web development FreeCodeCamp certification.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="practical-js">
                <header>PRACTICAL JAVASCRIPT: </header>
<p>This is, in my opinion, <a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript">the BEST course</a> for beginners. In the format of video-tutorial, it starts with JavaScript without presupposing any knowledge. So you begin playing with the Chrome console from the very beginning and you are introduced to the magic of the debugger very early on. While most JS courses focuses on the syntax (this is how you declare a variable, and this is how you do a for loop, etc), this course is project based, you learn the things when they are needed to accomplish the task at hand and the explanations are superb. The tutor focuses on the importance of UNDERSTANDING, as opposed to memorising a bunch of tags, keywords, syntax, etc.</p>
<p>While other courses throw piles of theory at you, (information that you can perhaps understand but not fully comprehend because you can't relate it to any real work), in this course you get practice first, you confront problems, you learn new strategies, and when the time is just ripe you get the theory and everything goes click. You can tell that behind the course design there has been a lot of work at deconstructing the (surprisingly complex) project of building a (seemingly simple) to-do app.<p>

            <section class="main-section" id="web-dev-bootcamp">
                <header>WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP:</header>
<p>This series of video-tutorials can be found in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Udemy</a> . 
It starts with the basics of HTML and CSS but you can skip to the juicy parts whenever you want. 
I haven't used this course much so I can't really write a proper review just yet. When I am done with Practical Javascript, 
I will probably jump into this one. One thing for sure it looks very complete.</p> 
<p>If I said in the introduction that having an active attitude is important (as opposed to just watching videotutorials or just reading) 
    it is also true that sometimes I just want to watch something and relax, or perhaps watch it while chopping my vegetables in the kitchen, 
    at these times this course comes handy.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="learning-how-to-learn">
                <header>LEARNING HOW TO LEARN:</header>
<p>As a foreign language teacher and as a learner of many different things, I have always been interested by that thing we call "learning". 
    So it was a matter of time that I would end up finding and doing <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">this course</a> . 
It is concise but offers a lot of good insights into good learning strategies, sometimes backed by latest neuroscience research. 
I did this course before I decided to become a web developer, but I think it has improved the way I study.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="project-euler">
                <header>PROJECT EULER: </header>
<p>An archive of mathematical challenges of increasing difficulty. 
    When you just want to practice your algorithmic skills, these sites give you just what you need: 
    problems to solve. Fortunately, this site is not the only one of its kind.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="decouvrez-js">
                <header>DECOUVREZ LE LANGAGE JAVASCRIPT: </header>
<p>I am also learning French because my goal is to land a developer job in France. Time is limited so it is a good strategy to combine several study-targets in a single activity. This is why this book, while not being specific for learning french, and while is definitely not the best resource for learning JS, it is a good read for my free time away from the screen.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="you-dont-know-js" >
                <header>YOU DON'T KNOW JS: </header>
<p>This book has been recommended by a lot of people, and is now in my e-reader. YDKJS is actually <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">a 6 book series</a> and you can read them for free. Its focus is on understanding JavaScript (not just the so-called "good parts" but also the weird parts) and on what happens underneath. </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="eloquent">
                <header>ELOQUENT JAVASCRIPT:</header>
<p>If YOU DON'T KNOW JS is to books, what John Keating is to teachers, <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a> would be the type of cold and distant Zen master that answers your questions with a riddle.</p>
<p>I wouldn't rely on <em>just</em> this book, because it often presupposes some knowledge that you may not have. I read a new chapter every month or so, and take my time with the exercises. The exercises are not always easy, but in my opinion, they are the most important part. This problem-solving process is weight-lifting for your brain. A path without obstacles is a path without learning.</p>
